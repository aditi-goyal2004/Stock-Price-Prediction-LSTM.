## 📝 Project Overview
This project uses **historical stock prices of Apple (AAPL)** from 2010 to 2025 to:  

- Predict prices on unseen data (**test set**)  
- Forecast **future stock prices** for the next 30 days  

The model is built with a **Stacked LSTM neural network**, which is excellent for learning patterns in time-series data like stock prices.

## 🛠 How to Run

1. **Clone or download** this repository.  
2. Install required libraries:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
## 📊 Expected Results

After running the notebook, you can expect:

- Plots showing **actual vs predicted stock prices**  
- **RMSE** values for train and test datasets  
- **30-day forecast** of Apple stock prices  

**Example Plots:**  

| Plot Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Historical vs Predicted | Shows how closely the model predicts past stock prices |
| Future Forecast | Shows projected stock prices for the next 30 days |
